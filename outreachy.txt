 Girls in India face discrimination both inside their homes and outside in their communities. This includes barriers, at all levels, to access quality education and within education systems, institutions, and classrooms, such as, amongst others: harmful gender stereotypes and wrongful gender stereotyping, child marriage gender-based violence against women and girls. In our college around 7% are girls. Which constantly challenges me to survive in a male dominant society and feel fear to achieve some career progress. By the end of the year, I was among 30% of girls interested in engineering. When I took the JEE exam, the most competitive entrance exam for engineering in India, I was among 27% of women taking this exam and among 15.41% girls who got qualified in the country. Being a middle class family, it is not very easy for the parents to educate their daughters because either they have to pay huge college fees or have to manage huge funds for her marriage and dowry. Such things are also great roadblock for the girls to fight for their right even with their family members and have to convince them “I will manage funds for my own marriage, please let pay for my Engineering.”
